* [MockFogLight](https://github.com/OpenFogStack/MockFogLight) A lightweight version of MockFog without a visual interface

Fog computing is an emerging computing paradigm that uses processing and storage capabilities located at the edge, in the cloud, and possibly in between. Testing fog applications, however, is hard since runtime infrastructures will typically be in use or may not exist, yet.
MockFog is a tool that can be used to emulate such infrastructures in the cloud. Developers can freely design emulated fog infrastructures, configure their performance characteristics, and inject failures at runtime to evaluate their application in various deployments and failure scenarios.

## Instructions

This project aims to provide a light version of [MockFog](https://github.com/OpenFogStack/MockFog-Meta) without a graphical user interface and the option to update characteristics at runtime to improve stability.
Thus, it should be mainly used to create an infrastructure testbed.

Code is largely based on the MockFog adoption of (flonix8)[https://github.com/flonix8/master-thesis-experiment].

### Requirements
Before running any roles, you should setup a virtualenv and install all requirements

```fish
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate.fish
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In addition:
- aws credentials configured in `~/.aws/credentials`
- valid AWS ssh key stored at `./mockfog.pem`
- read the individual READMEs for each role -> do what they say

### Create Testbed Definition

- configure the topology via `testbed/topologies.py`
- create the testbed definition with `python testbed/generate_testbed_definition.py`

### MockFog Topology
This role:
- bootstraps (or destroys) an AWS infrastructure based on the generated testbed definition
- adds the **testbed_config** field to hostvars; useable via other roles and templates, e.g., `hostvars[inventory_hostname].testbed_config.bandwidth_out` (actually done on the fly via `ec2.py`)
- sets the name, internal_ip, and role tag of EC2 instances
Use with:
```fish
ansible-playbook --key-file=mockfog.pem --ssh-common-args="-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" mockfog_topology.yml --tags bootstrap
ansible-playbook --key-file=mockfog.pem --ssh-common-args="-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" mockfog_topology.yml --tags destroy
```
### MockFog Network
This role:
- configures delays via TC
Use with:
```fish
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ec2.py --key-file=mockfog.pem --ssh-common-args="-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" mockfog_network.yml
```

### MockFog Application
This role:
- deploys application on nodes and starts it
- collects logs
Use with:
```fish
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ec2.py --key-file=mockfog.pem --ssh-common-args="-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" mockfog_application.yml --tags deploy
ansible-playbook -i inventory/ec2.py --key-file=mockfog.pem --ssh-common-args="-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" mockfog_application.yml --tags collect
```
